# WebDevelopmentWindows
Projects in this repository were created on Windows 10 64-bit.

The purpose is to test the benefits and drawbacks of working with the latest 
web development tools and frameworks on Windows as opposed to on OSX.

Projects (except those related to C#/.NET) in other jimxshaw repositories can be assumed to be developed on OSX.
